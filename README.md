Your class project is to come up with software application that does the following.

1. Build and Test an efficient floor plan for a warehouse

2. Uses C# (or Python) as a SW language

3. Asks user to input the size of the warehouse in three dimensions

4. Asks the user to input item names and sizes (three dimensions) that need to be stored in the warehouse

5. Outputs a list of the item names, sizes and location in the warehouse along with the total space used and remaining space.  If insufficient space is available when adding an item the user will be notified along with the amount of space available and the location of that space.
